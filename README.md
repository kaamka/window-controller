# window-controller
The project aims to augment smart home/environmental control system by providing an interface to control house’s windows, as well as sensor data allowing to fully utilize the system. The system will allow windows to open on user’s request, in relation to environmental conditions or in cooperation with other climate control systems, such as AC. The main potential benefits of the described system are: cost effective home climate control, disturbance management (closing windows when there is loud outside), safety features (such as CO gas detection).
